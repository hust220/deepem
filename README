## INSTALLATION

1.  Set the intel environment
    Edit the 'env.sh' file, and then type the command below:

        source env.sh

    If the user doesn't want to override the default environment, then this command could be omitted.

2.  Compilation
    Edit the 'compile.sh' file, and then type the command below:

        bash compile.sh

## USAGE

#### Preparation of the dataset

Please download the KLH data set: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sl7d1BR

#### Training

Here we take the KLH set as the example.
Enter into the 'test' directory:

    cd test

If the user use openmpi, then type:

    mpiexec -n 8 ../bin/rome_picker train -par KLH.train.pars
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh mpiexec -n 8 ../bin/rome_picker train -par KLH.train.pars

If openmp is used instead of openmpi, then type:

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 # 8 could be changed 

And then, type:

    ../bin/rome_picker train -par KLH.train.pars
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh ../bin/rome_picker train -par KLH.train.pars
   
'KLH.train.pars' is an example of the parameter file of the training procedure.    

The user could get help by typing:

    ../bin/rome_picker train -help
    # or
    # ../bin/rome_picker train -h
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh ../bin/rome_picker train -h 

#### Partical Picking

We still take the KLH set as the example.
Enter into the 'test' directory:

    cd test

If the user use openmpi, then type:

    mpiexec -n 8 ../bin/rome_picker predict -par KLH.pars
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh mpiexec -n 8 ../bin/rome_picker predict -par KLH.pars

If openmp is used instead of openmpi, then type:

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 # 8 could be changed 

And then, type:

    ../bin/rome_picker predict -par KLH.pars
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh ../bin/rome_picker predict -par KLH.pars

'KLH.pars' is an example of the parameter file of the particle picking procedure.    

The user could get help by typing:

    ../bin/rome_picker predict -help
    # or
    # ../bin/rome_picker predict -h
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh' before, then:
    # bash env.sh ../bin/rome_picker predict -h 

## Test

Enter into the 'test' directory:

    cd test
    ../bin/test
    # if the user didn't type 'source env.sh', then:
    # bash env.sh ../bin/test
